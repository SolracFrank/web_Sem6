                    Fight: The dancer has hard to read attacks. You should stay
                    always in her right 'cause in the first phase she attacks
                    repeatedly with the right hand. However; in the second phase
                    she gets a second weapon so; your only way to win is hit her
                    1-2 times and then dodge all her attacks

                    <br />
                    Fight: Perhaps he's the only boss who has a easier second
                    phase in comparison to his first one. In the first fase;
                    focus the main soldier; 'cause the rest of them only will
                    waste your estus. He can be parried and his attacks aren't
                    strong. Your best way to beat him is attack him like a PvP
                    match player.
